This directory is the starter project that is included with SDL 2.0.  Also
included with SDL 2.0, is a README.android file which gives general
instructions on how to adapt and extend it.  You may need to refer to that
file to get details this file assumes you already have.

Instructions:

1. Populate the jni/ directory.
   - Create a jni/libtcod/ directory.  A copy of the parent directory.
   - Create a jni/sdl2/ directory.  It should contain a copy of the SDL 2.0
     source code.  Perhaps revision efd48af40ec3.
   - Create a jni/png/ directory.  Perhaps the 1.4.6beta06 release.
